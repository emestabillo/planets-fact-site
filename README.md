## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started this project to practice React, but I soon realized I was writing the same code for every planet, since every page looks the same, and I thought there MUST be a better way. After some research - I found Nextjs. The dynamic paths seem like the solution I was looking for. That also meant a huge refactor of the entire React project.

I relied heavily on the official docs and articles to get it together. I had a lot of questions in development and looking back, I should've asked for help sooner to avoid unnecessary frustration. All in all, quite proud of this project since it pushed me to add a framework to my arsenal.

### Continued development

I now understand why they say it can be difficult to add animations in React. Changes in state and the DOM make it quite tricky. It's something I'd like to delve in a little more going forward.

### Useful resources

- I did an insane amount of googling since I wasn't intending to learn a framework on the fly, but [this blogpost](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-nextjs/) from [Ali Spittel](https://twitter.com/aspittel) was the one that got me started.

- For styled components, I used concepts I've been learning from Josh Comeau's [CSS for Javascript Developers](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js) course.
